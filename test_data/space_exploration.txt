Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.

The Solar System consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The largest of these objects are the eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. There are also dwarf planets like Pluto, dozens of moons, and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.

NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is an independent agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research. Established in 1958, NASA has led most of American space exploration efforts, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle.

The Voyager program is an American scientific program that employs two robotic interstellar probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and are now exploring the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space.

Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon.

The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory.

SpaceX is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has developed the Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship launch vehicles.

The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, lacking a significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field.

Exoplanets are planets outside our Solar System. The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917, but it was not recognized as such. The first scientific detection of an exoplanet began in 1988. As of 2024, there are thousands of confirmed exoplanets, with many more candidates awaiting confirmation. Some of these planets are located in the habitable zone of their stars, raising the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
